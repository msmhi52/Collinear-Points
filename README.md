# Collinear-Points
This code is for 3rd assignment of Algorithms, Part 1. Princeton Univercity, Coursera. It was implemented in **c++**.

### Description of code
Every files are consist of header file(.h) and source file(.cpp) except for LineSegment.h and main.cpp. 
The guideline of the assignment requires BruteCollinear.java which finds collineaer points in Brute Force algorithm. However, this commit doesn't include Brute algorithm. ~~So frustrating.~~

In assignment, nested code provides visualization of collinear points, but this code excludes visualization property.

Also, you can see four input files. After compiling and linking files:
>make
all you have to do is:
>start command input().txt
